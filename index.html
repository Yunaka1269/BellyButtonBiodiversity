But in reality, most of the organisms on our skin are our first line of protection from pathogens—organisms that can cause disease.<br><br>In 2011, the research team from the biology department of North Carolina State University (NC State) and the Nature Research Center (NRC) at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences discovered that belly buttons are very diverse habitats! In total, they discovered 2,368 different species. More than half of those may be new to science.<br><br>Each participant’s belly button hosted about 67 different species. Yet not one was common to every person, and only eight were found on at least 70 percent of participants. The researchers did learn, however, that the eight most common species were among the most abundant. This means that if a species was found in a belly button, that belly button usually had a lot of that species!<br><br>Roza's lab is partner with a food startup company called Improbable Beef and launches the project to research the bacteria species that have ability to synthesize the protain tastes like beef from human body.
